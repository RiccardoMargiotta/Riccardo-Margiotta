# Riccardo Margiotta

Hi! I'm working on my blog so that I can write about CSS, web performance, and all that fun stuff.

I'll be building it in the open, so you can follow along. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RiccardoMargiotta/Riccardo-Margiotta) is public too.

## What's next

- More basic styling and typography
- CSS build pipeline

## Upcoming blog posts

- Performant CSS skeleton loader animations
- Native CSS scrolling carousel with JavaScript nav indicators
